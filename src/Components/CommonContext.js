/* 
The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to manage global state and share data and functionality between components without passing props through multiple levels of the component tree. It provides a way to create a central store of data and make it accessible to any component that needs it.

Here's an overview of the key components and concepts involved in the Context API based on the files you provided:

CommonContext.js: This file creates a new context using the React.createContext() method. The CommonContext variable represents the context object.

App.js: The App component serves as the root component of your application. It wraps the component tree with the CommonContext.Provider component, providing the context value to all components within it. The context value is an object that contains the color state and the updateColor function.

Main.js, Header.js, Footer.js: These components consume the context value using the CommonContext.Consumer component. They access the color property from the context value and use it to style their respective elements.

UpdateButton.js: This component also consumes the context value using the CommonContext.Consumer component. It receives the updateColor function from the context value and uses it to update the color state in the App component when the buttons are clicked.

By utilizing the Context API, you can pass down the color state and the updateColor function from the App component to its child components without explicitly passing them through each component's props. This helps to avoid prop drilling and simplifies the process of sharing state and functionality across multiple components.
